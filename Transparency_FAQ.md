# Transparency.md for ALYMPICS

## Overview
ALYMPICS is a novel platform that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) agents into game theory scenarios. It aims to simulate human behavior in strategic decision-making environments, using a survival game model to explore the dynamics of multi-agent interactions and competition for limited resources.

## Objective
The main goal of ALYMPICS is to provide a controlled, scalable, and reproducible environment to study human-like strategic behaviors in AI agents. By incorporating varying degrees of resource availability and diverse agent personalities, the platform facilitates an in-depth analysis of strategic engagements and adaptations in complex socioeconomic contexts.

## Audience
This documentation is intended for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in the fields of artificial intelligence, game theory, and multi-agent systems. It addresses the potential applications, limitations, and optimal use of the ALYMPICS platform.

## Key Features
- Simulation of human-like behaviors in AI agents.
- Dynamic scenarios with adjustable variables like resource availability.
- Realistic modeling of multi-agent collaborations and competitions.
- Insights into strategic decision-making within AI systems.

## Limitations
- The behaviors of LLM agents in ALYMPICS might not perfectly mirror real human behaviors in every aspect.
- The current version focuses on a specific game scenario; further development is required to generalize the platform to other contexts.
- The platform's performance may vary based on the complexity of the game scenario and the computational resources available.

## Best Practices for Performance
- Ensure adequate computational resources for running complex simulations.
- Experiment with different settings of resource availability and agent personalities to observe varied strategic behaviors.
- Use the platform's adjustable variables to tailor the simulation to specific research questions or hypotheses.

## Social Impact Statement
ALYMPICS is designed to advance our understanding of AI's capabilities in strategic decision-making. While it offers valuable insights, we acknowledge the ethical considerations in deploying AI in real-world scenarios. We are committed to responsible research and development, ensuring that our work aligns with ethical guidelines and contributes positively to society. Our work is for research purposes only, and further testing and validation would be needed to use it outside of a research context.

## Feedback and Collaboration
We encourage feedback and collaboration from our audience. If you have suggestions, questions, or would like to contribute to the project, please contact us at Shaoguang.Mao@microsoft.com.

## Future Updates
The ALYMPICS platform is an evolving project. We plan to expand its scope to include a wider range of game theory scenarios and enhance the realism of agent behaviors. Stay tuned for updates in our code repository and other publications.

## Conclusion
ALYMPICS represents a significant step forward in the integration of AI into game theory. We hope that this platform will be a valuable tool for researchers and developers interested in exploring the strategic capabilities of AI agents.
